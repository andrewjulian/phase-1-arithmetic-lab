/* 1. Create a variable called `multiply` set to an equation that will multiply the
   variables `num1` and `num2`; the result of the multiplication should be `62`.
2. Create a variable called `random` that will generate a random integer greater
   than 0.
3. Create a variable called `mod` set to an equation that will calculate the
   remainder of dividing variable `num3` by `num4`; the remainder should be `4`.
4. Create a variable called `max` that finds the highest number in a set; the
   value returned should be `20`.
